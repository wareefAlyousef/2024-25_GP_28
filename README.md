## InsulinSync

Managing insulin dosages for individuals with Type 1 diabetes is a complex and high-stakes task due ‚Äéto the constant need to adjust for daily fluctuations in diet, exercise, and blood glucose levels. With ‚Äéthe pancreas unable to produce insulin, external insulin administration becomes essential for ‚Äésurvival. However, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is challenging, as they are influenced by ‚Äédynamic factors such as carbohydrate intake, physical activity, stress, illness, and sleep. This ‚Äévariability makes precise insulin dosing difficult.‚Äé

For example, consuming a high-carbohydrate meal can cause blood glucose levels to spike, ‚Äérequiring a larger insulin dose, while exercise typically lowers blood glucose, necessitating a ‚Äéreduction in insulin or additional carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia. A person with Type 1 ‚Äédiabetes may need to balance these opposing effects daily. Misjudging insulin needs can lead to dangerous consequences‚Äîtoo much ‚Äéinsulin may cause hypoglycemia during or after exercise. At the same time, too little insulin can result in ‚Äéhyperglycemia, leading to serious health risks. Chronic hyperglycemia increases ‚Äéthe likelihood of long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve ‚Äédamage. Acute hypoglycemia can trigger symptoms like dizziness, confusion, seizures, ‚Äéunconsciousness, or even death if not treated promptly. This constant balancing act requires ‚Äévigilance, flexibility, and real-time decision-making, often relying on personal intuition, which is not ‚Äéalways reliable.‚Äé

To address these challenges, ‚ÄúInsulinSync‚Äù provides real-time insulin dosage ‚Äérecommendations by integrating data inputs from food intake, exercise, and current glucose ‚Äéreadings. By offering tailored guidance based on real-time data, ‚ÄúInsulinSync‚Äù aims to minimize the ‚Äérisks associated with improper insulin management and empower users with safer, more effective ‚Äédiabetes control, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.‚Äé‚ÄÉ

### The Solution
To address the problem, we propose developing an application ‚ÄúInsulinSync‚Äù to help people with Type 1 diabetes manage their insulin dosage and maintain normal blood glucose levels.

The application features an optimization algorithm that pulls real-time glucose data from a continuous glucose monitor, collects exercise information directly from the user or by synchronizing it with fitness applications, and collects nutritional data in consumed meals. The application will provide users with multiple options to input their meal‚Äôs nutritional data and carbohydrate content, including scanning food item barcodes to automatically get the nutritional details, searching for the meal by its name, and manually entering the amount in grams and it will feature a tool that analyses images of meals to estimate their carbohydrate content, allowing the user to simply upload or take a picture of their meals. Before processing, the user verifies all the data. The verified information is then fed into the optimization algorithm, which calculates the recommended insulin dosage.

‚ÄúInsulinSync‚Äù application will provide a set of essential functionalities, including the 
following key features:
‚Ä¢	Personalized recommended insulin dosage calculation after entering the meal taking into account the user‚Äôs glucose level, the amount of carbohydrates in the meal, and the physical activity and it takes the user's verification before processing the information.

‚Ä¢	Connecting the application to a continuous glucose monitor to provide real-time glucose data and allow continuous tracking the glucose levels.

‚Ä¢	Integrating with health-related applications to track the users‚Äô exercises and gather information about their physical activity level. 

‚Ä¢	Image-based carbohydrate analysis model that can estimate the amount of carbohydrate in meals based on images that are taken by the user.

‚Ä¢	Barcode scanning for food products to retrieve their nutritional information particularly the amount of carbohydrates.

‚Ä¢	Visualizing the user‚Äôs glucose levels, insulin dosages, physical activity, and meal data to easily track and manage health information.

The solution will help improve diabetes management by simplifying the process of calculating the right amount of insulin dosage and reducing the risk of human calculation errors leading to better health status.

## üöÄ Launching InsulinSync App

### Prerequisites

Before launching the Android version of this Flutter app, ensure you have the following set up on your system:

- Flutter SDK (Latest stable version)
- Android Studio
- Android device/emulator
- A device with Developer Mode enabled or an Android emulator running

You can verify Flutter installation with the following command:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Ensure there are no issues with Android toolchain, Flutter, or device connection.

---

### Steps to Launch the App
#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wareefAlyousef/2024-25_GP_3.git
cd wareefAlyousef/2024-25_GP_3
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the project:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
#### 3. Set Up an Android Emulator (Optional)
If you want to test on an emulator, follow these steps:
-Open Android Studio
-Go to AVD Manager (Click the device icon in the top toolbar)
-Create a new virtual device (if none exists)
-Choose a device (e.g., Pixel) and the desired API level (min API should match your `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle`)
-Start the emulator

#### 4. Connect Your Android Device
If you are testing on a physical device:

- Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging on your Android device.
- Connect the device via USB.
- Ensure the device is listed by running:
```bash
flutter devices
```

#### 5. Configure Build Settings (Optional)
If you need to adjust build settings like minSdkVersion or app permissions:

- Navigate to `android/app/build.gradle` for SDK configurations.
- Adjust `minSdkVersion` or `targetSdkVersion` if necessary.

#### 6. Build the APK (Optional)
To build the APK file, which you can manually install on a device or distribute, use the following command:
```bash
flutter build apk
```

This command will generate an APK file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory. You can install it manually on your device or share it with others for testing.

Alternatively, to generate a release version of the APK (optimized for distribution):
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

#### 7. Run the App
To run the app on your connected Android device or emulator, use the following command:
```bash
flutter run
```
Flutter will detect connected devices and deploy the app to the selected one. If multiple devices are connected, it will prompt you to choose one.

---
### Troubleshooting
- Device not detected: Make sure USB Debugging is enabled and the correct drivers for your device are installed. You can verify device connection by running:
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```
- Build errors: Check the terminal output for any error messages. Common issues involve missing dependencies or SDK mismatches. Try running:
  ```bash
  flutter clean
  ```
  Then rebuild the app.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully launch and test the Android version of your Flutter app.
